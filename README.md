# Lightweight Go Application

## Overview

The **Lightweight Go Application** is a simple and efficient web server built using the Go programming language. It is designed to be easily deployable and scalable on Kubernetes using Helm, making it ideal for cloud-native environments.

This **end-to-end solution** showcases best practices for containerization, infrastructure as code, and observability in Kubernetes-based deployments. It integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization, providing valuable insights into the application’s performance.

## Features

- **Lightweight Web Server**: A basic HTTP server that responds on port 3000.
- **Containerized with Docker**: Built on the official Golang Docker image for simplicity and compatibility.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Easily adjustable replicas to scale horizontally based on demand.
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualization.
- **Helm-based Deployment**: Simplifies deployment on Kubernetes, ensuring consistency and version control.
- **End-to-End Solution**: From building, deploying, monitoring, to visualizing the application’s performance using Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: You need a Kubernetes environment such as Minikube, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), AWS EKS, etc.
2. **Helm**: Helm package manager is required to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes.
3. **Docker Hub Account**: A Docker Hub account to store and share the application image.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Lightweight Go Application:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lightweight-go-app.git
cd lightweight-go-app
```

### 2. Build and Push Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t your-docker-username/lightweight-go-app:latest .
docker push your-docker-username/lightweight-go-app:latest
```

### 3. Install the Helm Chart
```bash
helm install lightweight-go-app helm-chart/
```

### 4. Verify the Installation
Check the deployed resources:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

## Configuration

You can customize the application by modifying the `values.yaml` configuration:

- **Replica Count**: Set the number of replicas using the `replicaCount` parameter.
  ```yaml
  replicaCount: 2
  ```
- **Image Repository & Tag**: Customize the Docker image repository and tag.
  ```yaml
  image:
    repository: your-docker-username/lightweight-go-app
    tag: latest
  ```

## Monitoring and Visualization

To enhance observability, integrate Prometheus and Grafana:

### 1. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Helm
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Deploy Prometheus
helm upgrade --install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace --values helm-chart/templates/prometheus-values.yaml

# Deploy Grafana
helm upgrade --install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring --set adminPassword=myadminpassword --values helm-chart/templates/grafana-values.yaml
```

### 2. Port Forward Prometheus & Grafana
To access Prometheus and Grafana locally:
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-server 9090:9090 -n monitoring &
kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring &
```

### 3. Access Prometheus and Grafana
- **Prometheus**: `http://localhost:9090`
- **Grafana**: `http://localhost:3000`

Log in to Grafana with username: `admin` and the password set in `grafana-values.yaml`.

## Monitoring Setup

- **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from your application using the Prometheus monitoring setup integrated with Kubernetes.
- **Grafana**: Provides a rich visualization of metrics, dashboards, and insights into your application performance.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some tips:

1. **Check Logs**: 
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
   ```

2. **Prometheus & Grafana Errors**:
   - Verify Prometheus and Grafana pods are running using `kubectl get pods -n monitoring`.
   - Review dashboards in Grafana to ensure metrics are being collected correctly.

3. **Helm Issues**:
   - Ensure Helm repositories are properly added using:
     ```bash
     helm repo list
     helm repo update
     ```

This README provides detailed guidance on deploying, configuring, and troubleshooting your Lightweight Go Application with Helm and Kubernetes. It is designed as an **end-to-end solution**, incorporating Docker, Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana to cover all aspects of building, deploying, monitoring, and visualizing your application’s performance.
